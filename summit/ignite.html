		<h2>Submit a Talk &ndash; Ignite CfA!</h2>
		<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/12PqLHyTNts_fNZ52dWB-zfktq1Zwk3ybO54S64z7u7c/viewform" class="button">Submit your idea now!</a>

		<p>The evening of Wednesday, September 24, join us for snacks, drinks, and fun at Ignite #CfASummit at the Code for America Summit.</p>
		<p>An Ignite is a story that's exactly 5 minutes long, told by a speaker who's working with 20 slides that auto-advance every 15 seconds (ready or not). It's fun, it's fast, and the format forces you to really think about what you want to say.</p>
		<p>So what do you want to talk about?</p>
		<p>We &mdash; and 200 of your closest Summit friends &mdash; want to hear your cool ideas, hacks, lessons learned and "war stories." Your talk can be geeky, fanciful, poignant, educational, and/or funny. Submit your ideas today!</p>
		<p><strong>DEADLINE TO SUBMIT:</strong> Wednesday, September 17, 11:59 p.m. PDT. Accepted speakers will be notified by Friday, September 19, 3:00 p.m. PDT.</p>
		<p>If you haven't seen an Ignite talk, perhaps you'd like to:</p>
