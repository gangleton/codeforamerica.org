	<h3>Procurement Working Group FAQ</h3>
	<div class="layout-semibreve">
		<p>Code for America is convening a small, select cohort of highly committed cities to work closely with on improving procurement.</p>
		<h4>What does my government need to do as part of the working group?</h4>
		<p>To join the Working Group, you'll need to identify two designated staff members from your municipality to participate — one from a technology or innovation-focused department, and one from the procurement or legal department. Both participants will be expected to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Demonstrate substantial commitment to improving procurement in their municipality, and generate buy-in with relevant stakeholders and leadership.</li>
				<li>Participate in 2-3 preparatory phone calls with CfA staff and/or advisors before September 2014 to help us understand needs and priorities around procurement in your municipality</li>
				<li>Join 1-2 collaborative virtual roundtables with other cities to share ideas, give feedback, and learn from each other's approaches.</li>
				<li>Engage and facilitate collaboration with other relevant stakeholders within their government.</li>
				<li>Attend the CfA Summit (September 23-25 in San Francisco) and participate in 2-3 hours of working sessions on procurement</li>
			</ul>
		<p>These are the minimum participation expectations, and we hope to work closely with our working group partners to go above and beyond what's listed here.</p>

		<h4>What are the benefits of participating?</h4>
		<p>As a member of the working group, participants will:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn about best practices and cutting edge procurement improvements from around the country, and connect directly with experts who have first-hand experience.</li>
			<li>Get individualized support from Code for America staff and advisors in determining an action plan that fits your city’s unique needs, strengths, and priorities.</li>
			<li>Get free admission to the Code for America Summit and participate in a series of collaborative workshops and working sessions to put your plan into action.</li>
			<li>Gain national recognition as part of a pioneering group working on this important issue -- including recognition at the Summit, features in CfA materials, and other opportunities.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Sounds great! How do I apply?</h4>
		<p>Complete the interest form <a href="https://codeforamerica.wufoo.com/forms/z4z61om0se7ru9/">here</a> and Code for America staff will follow up about next steps.</p>
		
		<h4>I have another question that's not answered here.</h4>
