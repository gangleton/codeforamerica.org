                        <p>In early 2013, the City of Atlanta partnered with Start Up Atlanta to co-host the city’s first <a href="http://govathon.com/" target="_blank">Govathon</a> or city-wide civic tech hackathon. The effort not only sparked innovation and greater citizen collaboration, but it also released some of the city’s most useful <a href="https://atlanta.demo.socrata.com/" target="_blank">datasets</a>. In addition, the City of Atlanta also established <a href="http://www.atlantaga.gov/index.aspx?page=133" target="_blank">Focus on Results (FOR)</a> Atlanta, a performance focused strategy group that uses data to improve and augment strategic and operational goals across city departments.</p>
                        <p>In 2014, the Fellowship team will support Atlanta’s already strong tech community, and increase available data sets and community participation.</p>

                <h2>The 2014 Fellowship in Atlanta</h2>
            </header>

                    <div class="layout-gutters">
                        <p>When the Fellowship team in Atlanta met with Mayor Reed at the beginning of their Fellowship year, he identified three areas where improved technology could help foster better communications between citizens and government: the courts, city infrastructure, and transparency. With these considerations in mind, the ambitious Fellows are building several tools:</p>

                        <p><a href="http://court.atlantaga.gov/" target="_blank" alt="ATL Court">ATLCourt</a>, a new, user-friendly Atlanta municipal court website, allows citizens to look up their court cases, pay citations online, and get reliable answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/courtbot" target="_blank" alt="CourtBot">CourtBot</a>. Instead of traveling to the courthouse and standing in line &mdash; sometimes for hours &mdash; the 200,000 Atlanta residents who receive traffic tickets each year can now text their citation number to get information on how to pay the ticket or get information and reminders about their court dates.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/atl-procurement-rss" alt="ATL Procurement" target="_blank">ATL Procurement.</a> Another of the Atlanta team’s project is to raise the quality of vendors who contract with the city by increasing transparency and accessibility in the procurement process. In their research, they found that Atlanta receives responses from the same core group of suppliers, suggesting the need to reach out to a greater, more diverse market. By streamlining the process by which vendors submit their project proposals, as well as opening up data about purchasing and forecast through a widget and API, the Atlanta team hopes to increase competitiveness in the vendor market, thereby raising the quality of government contractors while saving taxpayers money.</p>
